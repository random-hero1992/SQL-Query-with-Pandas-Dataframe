# SQL-Query-with-Pandas-Dataframe
Jupyter Notebook scripts that automate data extraction from a SQL Server, python data manipulation, and exporting to excel.  All scripts are examples I've used from previous tasks or projects.

# Find changes in a database log
Find changes in a database log based on a specified date using a combination of SQL and pandas data frames. Use SQL for multiple queries on the SQL server and bring the outputs into pandas dataframes. Merge the dataframes and run a function, then export to Excel using openpyxl.
